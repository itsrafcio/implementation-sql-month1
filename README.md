# implementation-sql-month1

Goal: build a small, PM-oriented SQL portfolio focused on Implementation/Delivery metrics.

This repo will contain:
- /sql: schema, seed data, and queries (JOIN/GROUP BY) answering delivery questions
- /docs: short case notes and outputs (what question, what query, what insight)
- /docs/market: job-scan notes (keywords, tools, recurring requirements)

Main dataset: customers, projects, milestones, statuses, costs.
Outcome: 10+ practical queries and clear documentation in English.
