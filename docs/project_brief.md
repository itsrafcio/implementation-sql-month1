# Implementation Tracker – Project Brief

## What this project is
A small, SQL-based dataset simulating customer implementations, projects, milestones and costs,
designed to support delivery and implementation decision-making.

## Questions this dataset answers
- Which projects are over budget?
- Which milestones are delayed or stuck?
- Where do costs spike close to go-live?
- How many active projects does each customer have?
- What is the current delivery status across projects?

## Scope
SQLite database + a set of analytical SQL queries focused on delivery, cost and timeline signals.

## Non-goals
This is not a production system or a full BI solution.
