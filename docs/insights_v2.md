# Insights v2 (lead time & delays)

Lead time is the time between a planned milestone date and the actual completion date. In implementations, lead time shows whether delivery is predictable, and it helps detect early warning signals before go-live risk becomes visible in overall project status.

Tracking delays at milestone level also supports decision-making: where to add resources, what to escalate, and which dependencies are blocking progress. Even small recurring slippages across milestones can compound into missed go-live dates and budget overruns.
